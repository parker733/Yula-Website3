ABOUT -
<br/>
<br/>
Throughout my childhood, I love to sit on my grandfather’s lap to watch him play Xiangqi (Chinese Chess). My interest about Xiangqi starts there. During the summer-time, people often gather to play Xiangqi after dinner. Each of the Xiangqi pieces moves  like strings, evokes everyone’s tension. The excitement Xiangqi created are the most fascinating part of this game in my memory. 
<br/>
<br/>
Today the word Xiangqi seems to be fading. This board game starts to become so foreign generations by generations. I forgot the rules and often feel ashamed when looking at my grandfather plays Xiangqi alone.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I designed this book, limits the colors to black and white, aim to remind myself and others about this sad vanishing culture of Xiangqi. The book is designed bilingually, provides accessibility to larger audience who is interested about this culture. As a personal project, the contents of this book were organized and designed by meself, hope to contribute more to this game I love and respect.<br/>
