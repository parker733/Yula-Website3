CONCEPT -
<br/>
<br/>
Book design about Chinese Chess and the cultures behind. It is inspired by my childhood memory and personal interest in chess. The design includes a printed book, a paper-made chessboard, and an envelope of illustrated chess pieces. 
<br/>
<br/>BOOK INTERIOR -
<br/>
<br/>
The book is sized 4 9/10” x 9 2/5”, the traditional dimension of a Chinese chessboard. The book is designed bilingually, provides accessibility to a larger audience who is interested. It is printed on black. Colors are limited in grey scales, aimed to remind readers about the sad vanishing culture of Chinese Chess.

<br/>CHESSBOARD -
<br/>
<br/>
The chessboard is sized 4 9/10” x 9 2/5”, the same as the book which can be folded when carrying. The design breaks the rigid grids of traditional Chinese chessboard. The dragons represent the two conflicting powers (two players) in the game. The chessboard is made by sustainable paper, replacing the traditional material of wood to make it easier to carry.
<br/>
<br/>CHESS PIECES -
<br/>
<br/>
There are 36 pieces in total. Each is sized between 1 1/2” to 2”. The design replaced the Chinese letters on the traditional chess pieces with illustrated character to represent each pieces. Rules to play are written bilingually on the back of the pieces to make the game easier to enjoy. They are also paper-based, reinforced the cardboard so it is difficult to damage.
