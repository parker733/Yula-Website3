CONCEPT -

Printed covers for interior designer Yuxing Ling. Each book consists of one project developed in 2018. Ling and I agreed upon the importance of showing contrast, hierarchy, and systematic structures through the cover design.  
<br/>
<br/>ACTIVE RHYTHM -

Active Rhythm is the 2nd project in Lingâ€™s design series. Giving the name she aims to activate a repeated pattern of reflections and movement.  
<br/>
<br/>A SHELTER -

A Shelter is the 3rd project in the design series. The cover image is photographed to express the rawness of a structure without the excess decorations.
