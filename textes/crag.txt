The campaign introduces a new character, the Craigslistâ€™s man, aims to change the traditional rigorous corporate image, bring a contemporary and playful aspect to the brand. The campaign adjusts the original brand identity, develops a new illustrated visual system with brighter color choice and dynamic movement. The brand-representative color of blue was kept, pairing with high-saturated yellow to light up the design.
